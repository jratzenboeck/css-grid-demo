# css-grid-demo
A demo on how to work with CSS Grid.

## How to get started

1. `git clone https://github.com/jratzenboeck/css-grid-demo.git`
2. `cd css-grid-demo`
3. `./node_modules/browser-sync/dist/bin.js --start-server --files "**.*"`
4. Type `localhost:3000` in the browser and you will see the demo.
5. Play around with CSS Grid. Due to browser sync we have live-reload. So, when doing any changes in any of the files, they reflect immediately in the browser.
